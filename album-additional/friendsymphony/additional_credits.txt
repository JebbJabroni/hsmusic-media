Chesswanderlust did the very nice Bandcamp theme and header along with all the art for songs that didn't have track art yet a few days before release!

Tee-vee did a ton of work prooflistening / mastering the whole, very long album.

Scorpyus, Gryortharian, puns, and Tipsygnostalgic really stepped up to help organize the album and give ideas when I (Ucklin) got super busy. 

Makin uploaded the album and came up with the name, as well as making sure all the details I forgot were taken care of! 

This one truly couldn't have come out without some new people stepping up and doing work on the team, and I appreciate it immensely!
